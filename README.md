# Lance Deep Learning - recipes
<br />
Dive into building Deep learning pipelines using Lance datasets!
This repository contains examples to help you use Lance datasets for your Deep learning projects.

- These are built using Lance, a free, open-source, columnar data format that **requires no setup**.

- High-performance random access: More than **1000x faster** than Parquet.

- Zero-copy, automatic versioning: manage versions of your data automatically, and reduce redundancy with zero-copy logic built-in.

This repository is divided into 2 sections:
- [Examples](#examples) - Get right into the code with minimal introduction, aimed at getting you from an idea to PoC within minutes!
- [Tutorials](#tutorials) - A curated list of tutorials, blogs, Colabs and courses to give you a headstart in using Lance datasets for your Deep learning projects. 

## Examples
Practical examples showcasing how to adapt your Lance dataset to popular deep learning projects. 

Examples are available as:
* **Colab notebooks** - that builds the application is stages allowing you to investigate results at every intermediate stage.
* **Python scripts** - for cases where you'd like directly to use the file or snippets to integrate in your application

If you're looking for in-depth tutorial-like examples, checkout the [tutorials](#tutorials) section!
