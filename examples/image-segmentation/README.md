## COCO Image segmentation

### Overview
In this minimal example, we show how to train an Image segmentation model on the [COCO2017 Lance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heyytanay/coco2017-train-lance) created by the community. The example is very minimal in nature and is supposed to serve as a reference example on writing computer vision training scripts for lance datasets.
